### 1. **Data Collection & Preparation**
-   Gather more Ultimate Frisbee game videos for diverse scenarios.
-   Extract and save representative frames/screenshots from videos.
-   Annotate playing field, players, and disc in images (use Roboflow or similar).
-   Organize datasets into YOLO format (images, labels, data.yaml).

### 2. **Model Training**
-   Train/finetune YOLO segmentation model for field detection.
-   Train/finetune YOLO detection model for player and disc detection.
-   Experiment with data augmentation to improve model robustness.
-   Evaluate model performance and iterate on dataset/model as needed.

### 3. **Model Inference & Visualization**
-   Write scripts to run segmentation/detection on single images.
-   Write scripts to process entire videos and visualize results frame-by-frame.
-   Implement overlay of detected field, players, and disc on video frames.

### 4. **Game State & Event Detection**
-   Define criteria for game states (live play, stoppage, pre-pull, etc.).
-   Develop logic to infer game state from detection outputs.
-   Implement turnover and possession change detection.

### 5. **Analytics & Output**
-   Track player and disc movement over time.
-   Generate basic statistics (e.g., possession time, turnovers).
-   Create visualizations for tactical analysis (e.g., heatmaps, movement trails).

### 6. **Tooling & Automation**
-   Build tools for batch annotation and dataset management.
-   Automate training and evaluation pipelines.
-   Add configuration files for easy parameter tuning.

### 7. **Documentation & Usability**
-   Update README with clear usage instructions and examples.
-   Document code and add comments for clarity.
-   Prepare demo videos or screenshots for showcasing results.

### 8. **Future Enhancements**
-   Implement player identification (e.g., jersey number recognition).
-   Support for custom datasets and easy retraining.
-   Explore real-time processing capabilities.
